Probable Issue with Extraction from XML

In the next video, we will be extracting data from an XML file. For that we will be using an XML file titled "ProductXMLFull" from the course resources. We have tested with this file and most of the students also are able to load data from this file. However, some students are facing difficulty in importing data from this file. If you also face such an issue, please download another XML file titled "ProductXMLFull2.xml" which is attached as a resource in this lecture. Try importing data from this XML. If you still continue to face the issue, you can share a screenshot of the error to us and we will have a look at it. As a backup, you can use the attached CSV file to import the data. This CSV file contains the same data as the XML file, so you can import the data from the CSV file and go ahead with the course.
